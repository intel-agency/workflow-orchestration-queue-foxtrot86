### Required at Task Start
1. Call `read_graph` or `search_nodes` to load prior project context from memory
2. Call `sequential_thinking` to analyze the task, plan approach, and identify risks

### Required During Work
- Use `sequential_thinking` at key decision points and when debugging
- Persist important findings via `create_entities` / `add_observations`

### Required Before Commit/Push
- Run `./scripts/validate.ps1 -All` and fix ALL failures before committing
- Do NOT push until validation passes clean

### Required After Task Completion
- Store outcomes and lessons learned in the knowledge graph
- Confirm CI is green after push
